# Wine Quality Prediction

This project analyzes a dataset containing chemical properties of wine and predicts its quality using a machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier). The dataset is preprocessed, visualized, and used to train and evaluate the model.

## Features

- **Dataset Analysis**: Explores the relationships between chemical properties and wine quality.
- **Data Visualization**: Includes visualizations like bar plots, heatmaps, etc., to uncover patterns in the data.
- **Machine Learning**: Builds a Random Forest Classifier to predict wine quality.
